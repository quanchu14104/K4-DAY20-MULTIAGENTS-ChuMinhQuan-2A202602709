### Human
Analyse the sales data in `workspace/sales.csv` (see `workspace/README.md` for the column descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `north_q1_revenue` (number): sum of `amount` of the orders in region North placed in the first quarter of 2024, that is from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC up to and including 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC.
- `north_q1_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `north_q1_revenue`.
- `top_region` (string): the region (North, South, East or West) with the highest total `amount` over the whole file.
- `missing_amount_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose amount is missing.
- `duplicate_rows_removed` (integer): number of duplicate rows you removed.

Orders with a missing amount must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

## Summary

I've successfully analyzed the sales data and created `workspace/answer.json` with all required fields following Acme reporting conventions.

**Data Cleaning:**
- **Removed 7 duplicate rows** by keeping only the first occurrence of each order_id
- **Identified 8 orders with missing amounts** (marked as -999) and excluded them from revenue calculations
- **Normalized inconsistent data**: converted region names to title case (North, South, East, West) and parsed three different date formats (ISO-8601 with timezone, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD) to ensure accurate Q1 filtering
- **Processed 94 deduplicated rows** from the original 101

**Key Results:**
- **North Q1 2024 Revenue**: $3,130.24 (313024 cents)
- **North Q1 2024 Orders**: 10 distinct orders
- **Top Region**: North with $9,504.47 total
- **Missing Amount Orders**: 8
- **Duplicate Rows Removed**: 7

The output follows Acme's JSON schema and money formatting requirements with monetary amounts represented as integer cents and a required metadata block tracking data lineage.
